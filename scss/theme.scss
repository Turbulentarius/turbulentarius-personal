/*

    The Bulma .css file is massive (763 kB when everything is included).
    This MUST be reduced. To reduce the file size, I only include parts I am actually using.

    Thoughts
      In order to use Bulma classes, and have styles applied, we will need to add the relevant
      Bulma modules. The color module is needed for things like changing the background color,
      but it is extremely big. E.g. (194.44 kB)

      To avoid such massive bloat, we should probably define our own colors.
      For this reason alone, I will be extremely unlikely to ever use Bulma for personal projects.
