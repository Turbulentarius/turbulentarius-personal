          I am a Web Developer from Denmark with a diverse skill set and a

          Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Web Development at

            Fitness Engross was using an old version of <b>Shopware</b> that
            had various bugs and problems — all of which I solved — one of the
            most serious bugs prevented us from updating, and another serious
            bug prevented us from sending newsletters because of a
            <a href="https://beamtic.com/acl-permission-collection-error-in-shopware">clogged task system</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I am very satisfied with my accomplishments in this
            position, and deeply grateful that Fitness Engros entrusted me
            with their system, despite my lack of prior experience with
            Shopware.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was hired, I had limited experience with the technologies
            Shopware is built on. I quickly had to learn <i>Vue.js</i>,
            <i>Twig</i>, and how to set up <i>Elasticsearch</i>, with minimal
            assistance from other developers. In fact, I dug so deeply into
            Shopware's code that I discovered and reported
            <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/issues/2532">an issue</a>
            that was causing massive disk space usage in our shop.

          ~ <i>2021</i> to <i>2022</i> — Wordpress Developer
        </div>
        <div class="px-4 py-4">
          <p>
            I worked with various ad-hoc Wordpress development tasks for their
            clients. Doing this time I became quite good at creating and
            working with Wordpress plugins, as well as custom Themes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course I already had experience with PHP, but my familiarity
            with Wordpress was still limited to what I had learnt at KEA at
            this point.
          </p>

          <p>
            I mostly did front-end work that involved HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, typically created as CMS editor components or simply
            injected via custom plugins and themes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wordpress was a bit tough to work with, because some of their
            clients had absolutely huge <i>functions.php</i> file, which
            involved a lot of scrolling up and down just to find things. This
            was before I knew about <b>grep -r "something"</b>.
