          <p>Fitness Engross was using an old version of <b>Shopware</b> that had various bugs and
            problems — all of which I solved — one of the most serious bugs prevented us from updating.
          </p>

          <p>Overall I am very satisfied with my acomplishments in this position, and not least thankful
            that Fitness Engros entrusted me with their system.</p>

          <p>When I was hired, I had no previous experience with <b>Shopware</b>,
            including some of the technologies Shopware is built with.
            This meant I had to learn things like <i>Vue.js</i>, <i>twig</i>, and how to setup
            <i>Elasticsearch</i>,
            with little assistence from other developers.
            In fact, I was even diving so deeply into Shopware's own code, that I managed to discover
            and file <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/issues/2532">an issue</a> that was
            causing massive use of disk space in our Shop.
          </p>
          <p>I credit my former boss, Gitte Olrik, for getting me started with <b>TailwindCSS</b>,
            <b>Vue.JS</b>, and amusingly introducing me to the <b>grep</b> command.
            Her initial push has given me a solid foundation to build on, which proved valuable at
            Zealand.

        <div class="mb-4">~ <i>2021</i> to <i>2022</i> — Wordpress Developer</div>
        <div class="px-4 py-4">
          <p>I worked with various ad-hoc Wordpress development tasks for their clients.
            Doing this time I became quite good at creating and working with Wordpress plugins, as well
            as custom Themes.</p>

          <p>Of course I already had experience with PHP, but my familiarity with Wordpress was still
            limited to what I had learnt at KEA at this point.</p>

          <p>I mostly did front-end work that involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            typically created as CMS editor components or simply injected via custom plugins and themes.
          </p>

          <p>Wordpress was a bit tough to work with,
            because some of their clients had absolutely huge <i>functions.php</i> file, which involved
            a lot of scrolling up and down just to find things.
            This was before I knew about <b>grep -r "something"</b>.</p>
